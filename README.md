# Python-Distributed-Web-server
Designing replicated web server application using multithreading. Web application provides interoperability between computer systems on the Internet using REST (Representational State Transfer) architecture using AES-128 and RSA encrypted communications ▪Algorithm Applied: PAXOS, Berk Synchronization, Web Cache(Push/Pull), Lamport Clock, Ring Topology for leader election.


This project is a python based multi-threaded webserevr design based on socket communication for RPC and REST webservices for external communication.

The highlights are as follows:

▪ Designing replicated web server application using multithreading. Web application provides interoperability between computer systems on
the Internet using REST (Representational State Transfer) architecture using AES-128 and RSA encrypted communications
▪ Algorithm Applied: PAXOS, Berk Synchronization, Web Cache(Push/Pull), Lamport Clock, Ring Topology for leader election.
▪ Implemented fault recovery and fault detection.
